        "description": "'The narrative alternates between seductive languor and racy action which capture the opulence and drama of the Mughal kings. Sundaresan delightfully combines history and juicy gossip' - India Today Mehrunnisa - the Sun of Women - one of India's most legendary and controversial empresses ... a woman who overcame insurmountable obstacles through sheer brilliance and determination ... whose love shaped the course of the Mughal Empire. She is the twentieth wife. The daughter of refugees from Persia, growing up on the fringes of Emperor Akbar's opulent palace grounds, Mehrunnisa first encounters Prince Salim on his wedding day. Eight years old at the time, she decides that she too will one day become Salim's wife - unaware of the great price she and her family will pay for this dream. Skilfully blending the textures of history with the rich imaginings of a fairy tale, The Twentieth Wife sweeps readers up in the emotional pageant of Salim and Mehrunnisa's embattled love. From an ill-fated first marriage through motherhood and into a dangerous maze of power struggles and political machinations, Mehrunnisa searches for the true redemptive love she has never known. Mehrunnisa's and Salim's quest takes them, and the vast empire that hangs in the balance, to places they have never dreamed possible.",

Many of Sarojini Naidu's poems are infused with political and social commentary; but quite a few are simply musings on life; meditative and halcyonic. Though she has written poems on religion, country, women's freedom, etc., and her poems on nature occupy the first place in her poetry. Even in sorrow, her nature poems glow with a touch of her suffering. Sarojini Naidu's poetry is intensely Indian. The four volumes, The Golden Threshold (1905), The Bird of Time (1912), The Broken Wing (1917) and The Feather of Dawn (1961) of her poems present a clear picture of Indian scenes, sights and experiences transmuted into a fantastic vision of colour, sound and rhythm.",

        "description": "There is great interest in recent scholarship in the study of metropolitan cultures in India as evident from the number of books that have appeared on cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata. Though Hyderabad has a rich archive of history scattered in many languages, very few attempts have been made to bring this scholarship together. The papers in this volume bring together this scholarship at one place. They trace the contribution of different languages and literary cultures to the multicultural mosaic that is the city of Hyderabad How it has acquired this uniqueness and how it has been sustained is the subject matter of literary cultures in Hyderabad. This work attempts to trace some aspects of the history of major languages practiced in the city. It also reviews the contribution of the various linguistic groups that have added to the development not just of varied literary cultures, but also to the evolution of an inclusive Hyderabadi culture. The present volume, it is hoped, will enthuse both younger and senior scholars and students to take a fresh look at the study of languages and literary cultures as they have evolved in India's cities and add to the growing scholarship of metropolitan cultures in India.",

His invocation for the city was that millions of men and women of all castes, creeds and religions (should) make it their abode, like fishes in the ocean. In the same spirit, he first named the city Bhagnagar, after his Hindu consort Bhagmati. Later, when the queen was conferred the title of Hyder Mahal, he renamed the city after her to Hyderabad.

The book unfolds the vivid images of the customs and traditions of the Deccan. The reader may find him/her self sharing in the joys and sorrows of the people there, and cannot but acknowledge the intellect the city is known for. This feeling is aroused because the writers of the articles are either a part of the history of Hyderabad themselves, or know the city as the back of their hand.",

        "description": "In this brilliant and critically acclaimed debut book, Anirudh Kanisetti brings alive for the lay-reader the early medieval Deccan, from the sixth century CE to the twelfth century CE, in all its splendour and riotous glory. Kanisetti takes us back in time to witness the birth of the Chalukyas, a dynasty that shaped southern India for centuries. In vivid and colourful detail, Kanisetti describes how the mighty empires of medieval India were made: how temple-building and language manipulation were used as political tools; how royals involved themselves in religious struggles between Jains and Buddhists, Shaivas and Vaishnavas; and how awe-inspiring rituals were used to elevate kings over their rivals and subjects. In doing so, he transforms medieval Indian royals, merchants and commoners from obscure figures to complex, vibrant people. Kanisetti takes us into the minds of the powerful rulers of medieval south India – the Chalukyas, Pallavas, Rashtrakutas and Cholas dynasties, and animates them with humanity and depth. This painstakingly researched forgotten history of India will keep you riveted and enthralled. You will never see the history of the subcontinent the same way again.",

It had no authentic historical records, except a few inscriptions and architectural remains, till the end of the thirteenth century, when the Delhi sultans made their presence felt. A Mughal kingdom was eventually established in the Deccan, it would last for more than three hundred years, a fascinating period of valour and romance. This book connects the various histories of the Deccan, combining scattered references with the author's own research. The two volumes of History of the Deccan are an in-depth look at the opulence of the Mughal kingdom and how it slowly gave way to the political fortunes of the French and the Britishandthe creation of the Hyderabad contingent. Anecdotal and supplemented by delightful sketches and photographs, this book is an interesting as well as informative read.",

The book vividly takes you through the lives of eight Indians who lived in Deccan during this period and each of them had a unique aspect in them. These eight stories are woven together into a rich narrative tapestry and depict the social processes spanning over four centuries in the Deccan plateau.The first story is about Pratapa Rudra, a king who ruled over Coastal Andhra. When conquered by the Delhi Sultanate, he preferred to commit suicide rather be taken as a captive. The Delhi sultans annexed all regions and looked to spread their empire across India. The subsequent stories delve upon a Sufi saint, Muhammad Daraz, a Persian immigrant, Mohammad Gawan, Rama Raya, a general in the Vijayanagara Empire, Malik Ambar, an Ethiopian slave, Sant Tukaram, a Marathi poet, Papadu, a Telangana rebel, and Tarabai, a Maratha queen. All these people lived in differing social conditions in the same region at different periods of history. Each story depicts the changes that took place in the Indian history.",

At that time, the British needed to befriend the Nizams, more than the latter. As a nation within a nation, Hyderabad Dominion possessed an autonomous legislative, legal, and defence setup. The Asaf Jahi rule, which lasted for several centuries, had built up its own infrastructural paraphernalia, utilities like power and water, apart from transport, medical, and educational services. Praises showered by Mahatma Gandhi, Swami Vivekananda, Baba Saheb Ambedkar and Ravindranath Tagore on the Dominion find their mention in this book.

        "description": "The culture of Hyderabad was not only the extension of the Mughal culture with geographical distinctiveness, but also regionalized with special features known as Deccani culture, a distinct form of Oriental Culture. This volume analyses how and to what extent the regional influences in Hyderabad dominated while assimilating the features of the British Raj. ‘Paramountcy’ was a canny and self-serving concept invented by the British in the nineteenth century to assert their ‘indirect rule’ over the Princely States. The British Residents were the eyes and ears of the Raj. The present volume analyses in detail to what extent the Western cultural forms were, enforced or assimilated, in the way of manners, customs, etiquette, dress code and protocol. It also examines how liberal, secular English education was diligently promoted, not only for princes and nobles of Hyderabad but also local administrators. The volume concludes how this confrontation and assimilation of oriental and Western cultures led to the evolution of a new regionalized culture in Hyderabad state.",

        "price": 1676,
        "description": "n the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, courtliness was crucial to the political and cultural life of the Deccan. Divided between six states competing for territory, resources and skills, the medieval and early modern Deccan was a region of striking ethnic, linguistic and religious diversity. People used multifaceted trans-regional networks - mercantile, kinship, friendship and intellectual - to move across the Persian-speaking world and to find employment at the Deccan courts. This movement, Emma J. Flatt argues, was facilitated by the existence of a shared courtly disposition. Engagement in courtly skills such as letter-writing, perfume-making, astrological divination, performing magic, sword-fighting and wrestling thus became a route to both worldly success and ethical refinement. Using a diverse range of treatises, chronicles, poetry and letters, Flatt unpicks the ways this challenged networks of acceptable behaviour and knowledge in the Indo-Islamicate courtly world - and challenges the idea of perpetual hostility between Islam and Hinduism in Indian history.",

The cultural links which existed between the Deccan and the Middle East, for example, are clearly discernible in Deccani architecture and paintings and a remarkable collection of photographs, many of which have never been published before, testify to such influences. The book will be a source of inspiration to all those interested in the rich and diverse culture of India.",

        "price": 6622,
        "description": "The Deccan sultans left a grand architectural and artistic legacy. They commissioned palaces, mosques, gardens and tombs as well as decorative paintings and coins. Of these sultanates, the Nizam Shahs (r. 1490-1636) were particularly significant, being one of the first to emerge from the crumbling edifice of the Bahmani Empire (c. 1347-1527). Yet their rich material record remains largely unstudied in the scholarly literature, obscuring their cultural and historical importance. This book provides the first analysis of the architecture of the Nizam Shahs. Pushkar Sohoni examines the critical relationship between architectural production, courtly practice and royal authority in a period when the aspirations and politics of the kingdom were articulated through architectural expression. Based on new primary research from key sites including the urban settlements of Ahmadnagar, Daulatabad, Aurangabad, Junnar and the port city of Chaul, Sohoni sheds light on broader Islamicate ideas of kingship and shows how this was embodied by material artefacts such as buildings and sites, paintings, gardens, guns and coins.As well as offering a vivid depiction of sixteenth-century South Asia, this book revises understanding of the cultural importance of the Nizam Shahs and their place in the Indian Ocean world. It will be a vital primary resource for scholars researching the history of the medieval and early modern Deccan and relevant for those working in Art History, Islamic Studies, South Asian Studies and Archaeology.",

        "description": "A survey of the stunningly beautiful visual and decorative arts created by India's Deccan kingdoms. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Deccan plateau of south-central India was home to a series of important, highly cultured Muslim kingdoms and was a nexus of international trade. Invigorated by cultural connections to Iran, Turkey, East Africa, and Europe, Deccani art is celebrated for its unmistakable, otherworldly character: in painting, a poetic lyricism; in architecture, a somber grandeur; and in the decorative arts, lively creations in inlaid metalwork and dyed textiles. This beautifully illustrated catalogue, which includes extraordinary new site photographs and lush landscape images, along with discussions of 200 of the finest Deccani works, creates the most comprehensive examination to date of this fascinating and remote world. The text not only discusses paintings, drawings, textiles, arms, manuscripts, and other decorative arts from this rich culture, but also explores the history, architecture, literature, and music of the period. Essays by prominent international authors, supplemented by informative maps, illustrated appendices, and select primary sources, make this pioneering book a key resource on the subject.",
